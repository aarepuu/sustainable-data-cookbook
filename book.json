	"description": "Data has become the de facto ingredient in decision-making processes and its value has increased in the past 5 years to the point that some call data “the new oil”. Decisions on how data is collected, stored and used, are having major long-term environmental, economic, and social impacts. However, we are not yet thinking about data sustainably – consequently, our relationship with data is detrimental to the health of the internet and society. In this cookbook, we offer series of data recipes, step-by-step easy to follow guides, that can change our working practices with data across its lifecycle. This resource can be used to engage with data practitioners and the wider community, who have interests in working toward a sustainable data future. \n\nThis cookbook started from a workshop ran at [MozFest22|https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/s/K7E9EG-1], but is now a living open-source document on GitHub. To submit ideas and feedback use [issues|https://github.com/aarepuu/sustainable-data-cookbook/issues] on the cookbook's GitHub page.",
