We live in the era of the information age, computers, digital technologies, and the Internet, which have completely transformed how we live, play, work and communicate with others. Consequently, data are exchanged and accumulated to sustain this ecosystem of constant change. The scale and speed of this data generation however is something to ponder over. It is estimated that in 2022 the world would produce and consume 94 ~zettabytes~zettabyte of data <idcstatista20>. No wonder the term ~datum~datum is rarely used any longer and seems to be gradually disappearing from our vocabulary.

As a backbone of this digital world, data are often though about something that extremely valuable that needs to be gathered and stored as much as possible. Some have taken it as far as calling data “_the new oil_”, a new natural resource that needs to be mined. We are now at a pivotal point in history where data is becoming a disruptive force across many disciplines, a source of truth, wealth, and power, but with environmental, economic, and societal costs attached. Decisions on how data is collected, stored and used, are having major long-term environmental, economic, and social impacts. However, we are not yet thinking about data sustainably – consequently, our relationship with data is detrimental to the health of the internet and society.


# Sustainable Data Principles

Humans use natural resources and fabricated materials to produce goods which help satisfy our everyday needs and wants. However, growth of consumerism in modern societies has had a decremental impact to environmental sustainability. As a result, people have turned their attention to recycling practices to try to restore the balance. Similarly, thinking of data as a resource that people control and applying similar practices to it could help improve overall sustainability of data. As so, we define Sustainable Data using thinking from environmental sustainability and the application of the three R’s – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, additionally extending to further principles of recycling - Rot, Refuse, Recover and Rethink.

### R1: Reduce single use resoures

1. Before collecting new data seek for data that already exist and can be obtained, sourced or negotiated?
2. Ensuring that data collection is not serving a single purpose or group and can be reused and recycled by others.
3. Promoting reuse and recycling by making documentation and generation of meta- and paradata part of the primary data collection process.
4. Reflecting on the shelf life of the dataset; anticipating the relevance of data in longer term and changing conditions.

|R2.png|R2 Reuse principle|R2: Reuse data for the same purpose.|Aare Puussaar|

### R2: Reuse data for the same purpose

1. Ensuring that data are accompanied with relevant and up to date meta- and paradata.
2. Making sure that any restrictions on data are universal and do not inhabit recycling.
3. Applying strategies to transform data into a form suitable for recycling.

|R3.png|R3 Recycle principle|R3: Recycle data for different purposes.|Aare Puussaar|

### R3: Recycle data for different purposes

1. Ensuring that data are accompanied with relevant and up to date meta- and paradata, or provide universal routes for renegotiation and recovery of them.
2. Including a reuse policy to data that states explicitly what restrictions and rights apply.
3. Organising data in a standardised way, or if proprietary or non-standardised ways of are used describing it in the accompanied metadata.
4. Having a trace to origin of data and making sure that recycled data upholds the same Sustainable Data principles.

|R4.png|R4 Rot principle|R4: Rot - manage disposal of data.|Aare Puussaar|

### R4: Rot - manage disposal of data

1. Ensuring the correct managing and disposal of redundant, obsolete or trivial datasets.
2. Illustrating sustainability of the managed datasets to the data subjects.
3. Implementing fair mechanisms for exclusion and inclusion from datasets.

|R5.png|R5 Refuse principle|R5: Refuse to be included in data.|Aare Puussaar|

### R5: Refuse to be included in data

1. Excersising the right to refuse or opt out from non-sustinable data collection (also under *GDPR*{[General Data Protection Regulation|https://gdpr.eu/]}).
2. Underestanding commitments to sustainability from the data generator or steward.
3. Exercising the right to erasure from non-sustainable dataset (also under GDPR).
4. Underestanding the impacts of refusal to be included in the dataset.

|R6.png|R6 Recover principle|R6: Recover access and use of data.|Aare Puussaar|

### R6: Recover single use resoures

1. Requesting access to your data for reuse and recycling (also under GDPR).
2. Understanding the routes to recovery or negotiation of access for reuse and recycling.
3. Repairing and building links to reuse and recycling of data.

|R7.png|R7 Rethink principle|R7: Rethink the sustainability of data.|Aare Puussaar|

### R7: Rethink the sustainability of data

1. Revising the decisions and rules in place for sustainability of datasets.
2. Understanding and reviewing the beneficiaries of sustainability to data.
3. Restructuring historical the data to make it reusable and recyclable or managing the disposal of it.
4. Embedding monitoring of sustainability as part of data management process.
5. Implementing harm mitigation mechanisms to mitigate risk and even compensate harms done.
