Data are often though about something that extremely valuable that needs to be gathered and stored as much as possible. Some have taken it as far as calling data “the new oil”, a new natural resource that needs to be mined...

The term ~datum~datum is rarely used any longer and seems to be gradually disappearing from our vocabulary.

# Sustainable Data Principles

|R1.png|R1 Reduce principle|R1: Reduce single use resoures.|Aare Puussaar|

### R1: Reduce single use resoures

1. Before collecting new data seek for data that already exist and can be obtained, sourced or negotiated?
2. Ensuring that data collection is not serving a single purpose or group and can be reused and recycled by others.
3. Promoting reuse and recycling by making documentation and generation of meta- and paradata part of the primary data collection process.
4. Reflecting on the shelf life of the dataset; anticipating the relevance of data in longer term and changing conditions.

### R2: Reuse data for the same purpose

1. Ensuring that data are accompanied with relevant and up to date meta- and paradata.
2. Making sure that any restrictions on data are universal and do not inhabit recycling.
3. Applying strategies to transform data into a form suitable for recycling.

### R3: Recycle data for different purposes

1. Ensuring that data are accompanied with relevant and up to date meta- and paradata, or provide universal routes for renegotiation and recovery of them.
2. Including a reuse policy to data that states explicitly what restrictions and rights apply.
3. Organising data in a standardised way, or if proprietary or non-standardised ways of are used describing it in the accompanied metadata.
4. Having a trace to origin of data and making sure that recycled data upholds the same Sustainable Data principles.

|R4.png|R4 Rot principle|R4: Rot - manage disposal of data.|Aare Puussaar|

### R4: Rot - manage disposal of data

1. Ensuring the correct managing and disposal of redundant, obsolete or trivial datasets.
2. Illustrating sustainability of the managed datasets to the data subjects.
3. Implementing fair mechanisms for exclusion and inclusion from datasets.

|R5.png|R5 Refuse principle|R5: Refuse to be included in data.|Aare Puussaar|

### R5: Refuse to be included in data

1. Excersising the right to refuse or opt out from non-sustinable data collection (also under *GDPR*{[General Data Protection Regulation|https://gdpr.eu/]}).
2. Underestanding commitments to sustainability from the data generator or steward.
3. Exercising the right to erasure from non-sustainable dataset (also under GDPR).
4. Underestanding the impacts of refusal to be included in the dataset.

### R1: Reduce single use resoures

1. Before collecting new data seek for data that already exist and can be obtained, sourced or negotiated?
2. Ensuring that data collection is not serving a single purpose or group and can be reused and recycled by others.
3. Promoting reuse and recycling by making documentation and generation of meta- and paradata part of the primary data collection process.
4. Reflecting on the shelf life of the dataset; anticipating the relevance of data in longer term and changing conditions.
